# Analyze-NYSE-Data

**Project Description**

 In this project, we will study real-world data from the New York Stock Exchange.  The project will be based on a portion of Kaggle's massive dataset of historical financial data from S&P 500 firms.
 
 The main aim of this project is to demostrate the following skills:
 
  - interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range)
  - use a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, drop downs, data validation, VLOOKUP).
  - analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel or Google Sheets.
  - create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel or Google Sheets to create a financial forecast model.
